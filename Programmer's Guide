The documents in this unit dive into the details of writing TensorFlow code. This section begins with the following guides, each of which explain a particular aspect of TensorFlow:

Variables: Creation, Initialization, Saving, and Loading, which details the mechanics of TensorFlow Variables.
Tensor Ranks, Shapes, and Types, which explains Tensor rank (the number of dimensions), shape (the size of each dimension), and datatypes.
Sharing Variables, which explains how to share and manage large sets of variables when building complex models.
Threading and Queues, which explains TensorFlow's rich queuing system.
Reading Data, which documents three different mechanisms for getting data into a TensorFlow program.
The following guide is helpful when training a complex model over multiple days:

Supervisor: Training Helper for Days-Long Trainings, which explains how to gracefully handle system crashes during a lengthy training session.
TensorFlow provides a debugger named tfdbg, which is documented in the following two guides:

TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) Command-Line-Interface Tutorial: MNIST, which walks you through the use of tfdbg within an application written in the low-level TensorFlow API.
How to Use TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) with tf.contrib.learn, which demonstrates how to use tfdbg within the Estimators API.
A MetaGraph consists of both a computational graph and its associated metadata. A MetaGraph contains the information required to continue training, perform evaluation, or run inference on a previously trained graph. The following guide details MetaGraph objects:

Exporting and Importing a MetaGraph.
To learn about the TensorFlow versioning scheme, consult the following two guides:

TensorFlow Version Semantics, which explains TensorFlow's versioning nomenclature and compatibility rules.
TensorFlow Data Versioning: GraphDefs and Checkpoints, which explains how TensorFlow adds versioning information to computational graphs and checkpoints in order to support compatibility across versions.
We conclude this section with a FAQ about TensorFlow programming:
